### In this folder you can fnd the training pipelines for the classification (multiple different architectres) and objected detection (YOLOv4) models ine notebook formats:
* CTPA-Scan images classification - [Transfer learning pipline](Transfer_Learning_Pipeline.ipynb) for pulmonary embolism identification with multiple architectures
* Pulmonary embolism localization in CTPA-Scan images with [YOLOv4 ](YOLOv4_Training_on_CT_Scan_Images.ipynb) model
